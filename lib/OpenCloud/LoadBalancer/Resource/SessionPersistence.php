/**
 * Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service that forces 
 * multiple requests, of the same protocol, from clients to be directed to the 
 * same node. This is common with many web applications that do not inherently 
 * share application state between back-end servers. Two session persistence 
 * modes are available, as described in the following table:
 * 
 * * HTTP_COOKIE: A session persistence mechanism that inserts an HTTP cookie 
 *      and is used to determine the destination back-end node. This is supported 
 *      for HTTP load balancing only.
 * 
 * * SOURCE_IP: A session persistence mechanism that will keep track of the 
 *      source IP address that is mapped and is able to determine the destination 
 *      back-end node. This is supported for HTTPS pass-through and non-HTTP 
 *      load balancing only.
