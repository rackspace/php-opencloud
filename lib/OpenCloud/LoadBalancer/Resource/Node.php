/**
 * The nodes defined by the load balancer are responsible for servicing the
 * requests received through the load balancer's virtual IP. By default, the
 * load balancer employs a basic health check that ensures the node is listening
 * on its defined port. The node is checked at the time of addition and at regular
 * intervals as defined by the load balancer health check configuration. If a
 * back-end node is not listening on its port or does not meet the conditions of
 * the defined active health check for the load balancer, then the load balancer
 * will not forward connections and its status will be listed as "OFFLINE". Only
 * nodes that are in an "ONLINE" status will receive and be able to service
 * traffic from the load balancer.
 *
 * All nodes have an associated status that indicates whether the node is
 * ONLINE, OFFLINE, or DRAINING. Only nodes that are in ONLINE status will
 * receive and be able to service traffic from the load balancer. The OFFLINE
 * status represents a node that cannot accept or service traffic. A node in
 * DRAINING status represents a node that stops the traffic manager from sending
 * any additional new connections to the node, but honors established sessions.
 * If the traffic manager receives a request and session persistence requires
 * that the node is used, the traffic manager will use it. The status is
 * determined by the passive or active health monitors.
 *
 * If the WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN load balancer algorithm mode is selected, then
 * the caller should assign the relevant weights to the node as part of the
 * weight attribute of the node element. When the algorithm of the load balancer
 * is changed to WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN and the nodes do not already have an
 * assigned weight, the service will automatically set the weight to "1" for all nodes.
 *
 * One or more secondary nodes can be added to a specified load balancer so that
 * if all the primary nodes fail, traffic can be redirected to secondary nodes.
 * The type attribute allows configuring the node as either PRIMARY or SECONDARY.
