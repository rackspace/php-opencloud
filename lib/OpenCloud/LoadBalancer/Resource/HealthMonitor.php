/**
 * Active health monitoring is a technique that uses synthetic transactions 
 * executed at periodic intervals to determine the condition of a node. One of 
 * the advantages of active health monitoring is that it does not require active 
 * transactions to be processed by the load balancer to determine whether or not 
 * a node is suitable for handling traffic. Active health monitoring is not 
 * applied by default and must be enabled per load balancer.
 * 
 * The active health monitor can use one of three types of probes:
 * 
 * * connect
 * * HTTP
 * * HTTPS
 * 
 * These probes are executed at configured intervals; in the event of a failure, 
 * the node status changes to OFFLINE and the node will not receive traffic. If, 
 * after running a subsequent test, the probe detects that the node has recovered, 
 * then the node's status is changed to ONLINE and it is capable of servicing requests.
