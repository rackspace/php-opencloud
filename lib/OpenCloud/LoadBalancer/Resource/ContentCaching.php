/**
 * When content caching is enabled, recently-accessed files are stored on the

 * performance of high traffic web sites by temporarily storing data that was
 * recently accessed. While it's cached, requests for that data will be served
 * by the load balancer, which in turn reduces load off the back end nodes. The
 * result is improved response times for those requests and less load on the web
 * server.
