/**
 * When content caching is enabled, recently-accessed files are stored on the 
 * load balancer for easy retrieval by web clients. Content caching improves the 
 * performance of high traffic web sites by temporarily storing data that was 
 * recently accessed. While it's cached, requests for that data will be served 
 * by the load balancer, which in turn reduces load off the back end nodes. The 
 * result is improved response times for those requests and less load on the web 
 * server.
 * 
 * @todo Should this be a separate class, or a property of LoadBalancer?
