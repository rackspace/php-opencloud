/**
 * Cloud Queues is an open source, scalable, and highly available message and 
 * notifications service. Users of this service can create and manage a 
 * "producer-consumer" or a "publisher-subscriber" model from one simple API. It 
 * is made up of a few basic components: queues, messages, claims, and stats.
 * 
 * In the producer-consumer model, users create queues where producers 
 * can post messages. Workers, or consumers, may then claim those messages and 
 * delete them once complete. A single claim may contain multiple messages, and 
 * administrators are given the ability to query claims for status.
 * 
 * In the publisher-subscriber model, messages are posted to a queue like above, 
 * but messages are never claimed. Instead, subscribers, or watchers, simply 
 * send GET requests to pull all messages since their last request. In this 
 * model, a message will remain in the queue, unclaimed, until the message's 
 * time to live (TTL) has expired.
 * 
 * Here is an overview of the Cloud Queues workflow:
 * 
 * 1. You create a queue to which producers post messages.
 * 
 * 2. Producers post messages to the queue.
 * 
 * 3. Workers claim messages from the queue, complete the work in that message, 
 *      and delete the message.
 * 
 * 4. If a worker plans to be offline before its message completes, the worker 
 *      can retire the claim TTL, putting the message back into the queue for 
 *      another worker to claim.
 * 
 * 5. Subscribers monitor the claims of these queues to keep track of activity 
 *      and help troubleshoot if things go wrong.
 *
 * For the majority of use cases, Cloud Queues itself will not be responsible 
 * for the ordering of messages. If there is only a single producer, however, 
 * Cloud Queueing guarantees that messages are handled in a First In, First Out 
 * (FIFO) order.
