Welcome to php-opencloud!
=========================

Installation
------------

You must install this library through Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

  composer require rackspace/php-opencloud


If you do not have Composer installed, please consult the `official docs
<https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`_.

Once you have installed the library, you will need to load Composer's autoloader
(which registers all the required namespaces). To do this, place the following
line of PHP code at the top of your application's PHP files:

.. code-block:: php

  require 'vendor/autoload.php';

This assumes your application's PHP files are located in the same folder as
``vendor/``. If your files are located elsewhere, please supply the path to
``vendor/autoload.php`` in the require statement above.

Read the :doc:`getting-started-with-openstack` or
:doc:`getting-started-with-rackspace` to help you get started with basic
Compute operations.

.. note::

  If you are running PHP 5.3, please see our :doc:`using-php-5.3` guide.
